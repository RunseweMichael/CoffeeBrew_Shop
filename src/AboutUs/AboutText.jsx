      <h1 className='about-title'>OUR STORY BEGINS WITH A BEAN!!!</h1>
      <h4 className='about-subtitle'>Founded in 2024, Coffee Brew began 
        as a humble coffee cart on the streets of Lagos.
         What started with a passion for rich, flavorful
          coffee quickly grew into a mission: to bring 
          people together through the art of great brewing.
          <br /> <br />
            Every bean we roast tells a storyâ€”from the 
            highlands of Ethiopia to the plantations of 
            Colombia. We work directly with farmers, 
            ensuring fair trade practices, and roast in 
            small batches to preserve the natural complexity 
            of each origin.
